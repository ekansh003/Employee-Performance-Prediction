        <p>
            Employees are the most valuable asset of any organization. Their productivity directly impacts
            operational efficiency and business growth. Companies that monitor and enhance employee performance
            gain a competitive advantage through improved outcomes.
        </p>
        <p>
            This project utilizes machine learning to predict the productivity level of employees based on
            various measurable parameters such as overtime, incentive, team size, idle time, and more.
        </p>
        <p>
            With data-driven insights, organizations can optimize task distribution, support low-performing teams,
            and reward high achievers.
